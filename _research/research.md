Research Interests
======
I am generally interested in understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases by applying existing and developing novel statistical and computational tools.

<br>
Current Research
======

* Analyzed the scRNA-seq data of ~1 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ~1,000 individuals 
* Identified genetic variants associated with intra-individual variance on the gene expression level 
* Integrated multi-omics data to discover novel biomarkers for autoimmune diseases

<br>
Past Research
======      

**GWAS and post-GWAS**

I integrated multi-omics data to prioritize functional genes and regulatory mechanisms of type 2 diabetes


**Population Genetics**

I investigated how misreported and longitudinal changes bias the genetic analysis of behavioral traits


**Causal Inference**

I co-developed a new algorithm for heterogeneity filtering and an R software package ([GSMR2](https://github.com/jianyanglab/gsmr2)) for Mendelian Randomization analysis
