I am a Postdoc Scientist in [Powell Lab](https://www.garvan.org.au/about-us/people/jospow) at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research. My current research is focused on identifying the genetic control of gene expression variability at the single-cell level. To achieve this goal, I am developing novel statistical methods for single-cell eQTL mapping and applying them to the [OneK1K](https://onek1k.org/about) cohort which contains gene expression profiles of 1.2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ~1,000 individuals. This work would help to understand how genetic variants contribute to gene expression regulation at the single-cell level. I will also lead the work on gene regulatory network inference and multi-omics integration for the [TenK10K](https://www.bio-itworld.com/news/2022/06/08/genetic-control-of-autoimmune-disease-mapped-to-cellular-level) cohort, the extended version of OneK1K.

I obtained my PhD in 2021 at The University of Queensland working with Prof. [Jian Yang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/jian-yang.html) in the field of statistical genetics. During my PhD, I utilised statistical and computational methods to dissect the genetic architecture of human complex diseases, perform meta-analyses and integrate multi-omics data to identify associated gene loci and gene regulatory mechanisms. I conducted [the largest genetic study of type 2 diabetes](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2018/07/largest-genetic-study-of-type-2-diabetes-offers-hope-of-better-treatment) and highlighted three T2D-associated genes with plausible regulatory mechanisms where a genetic variant exerts an effect on T2D through epigenetic regulation of gene expression. I also co-developed a software tool ([GSMR2]([https://github.com/jianyanglab/gsmr2](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gsmr/))) for evaluating the causal relationship between modifiable risk factors and complex diseases. I was awarded the DeLill Nasser Award for Professional Development in Genetics (Genetics Society of America) in recognition of my PhD work. Before moving to Australia, I completed the BSc (Agronomy) at Zhejiang University, China in 2015.
