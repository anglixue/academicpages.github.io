I am a Postdoc Scientist in [Powell Lab](https://www.garvan.org.au/research/labs-groups/computational-genomics-lab) at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research. My current research is focused on **identifying the genetic control of gene expression variability at the single-cell level**. To achieve this goal, I am developing novel statistical methods for single-cell variance eQTL mapping and applying them to the [OneK1K](https://onek1k.org/about) cohort which contains gene expression profiles of 1.2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ~1,000 individuals. This work would help to understand how genetic variants contribute to gene expression regulation at the single-cell level. I am also leading the work on gene regulatory network inference and multi-omics integration for the expanded version of OneK1K, i.e., [TenK10K](https://www.bio-itworld.com/news/2022/06/08/genetic-control-of-autoimmune-disease-mapped-to-cellular-level) cohort, which will curate single-cell profiling for > 50 million cells from 10,000 individuals.

I obtained my PhD in 2021 at The University of Queensland working with Prof. [Jian Yang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/jian-yang.html) in the field of statistical genetics. During my PhD, I utilised statistical and computational methods to dissect the genetic architecture of human complex diseases, perform meta-analyses, and **integrate multi-omics data to identify causal genes and genetic regulatory mechanisms**. I conducted [the largest genetic study of type 2 diabetes](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2018/07/largest-genetic-study-of-type-2-diabetes-offers-hope-of-better-treatment) and highlighted three T2D-associated genes with plausible regulatory mechanisms where a genetic variant exerts an effect on T2D through epigenetic regulation of gene expression. I also co-developed a software tool ([GSMR2](https://github.com/jianyanglab/gsmr2) for **evaluating the causal relationship between modifiable risk factors and complex diseases**. I was awarded the DeLill Nasser Award for Professional Development in Genetics (Genetics Society of America) in recognition of my PhD work.
